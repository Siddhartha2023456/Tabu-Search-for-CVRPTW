# Tabu-Search-for-CVRPTW
This project implements a Tabu Search heuristic for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) in C#. In CVRPTW, a fleet of vehicles with limited capacity must deliver to customers within specific time windows while minimizing the total distance traveled. The Tabu Search algorithm iteratively explores neighboring solutions by swapping customers between routes, tracks recent moves to avoid revisiting suboptimal solutions, and updates the best solution found. The code is designed to be flexible, with configurable parameters for tabu list size, neighborhood size, and max iterations. Potential enhancements include advanced neighborhood moves, adaptive tabu list size, and parallelization for faster execution on larger instances. To use the code, simply initialize customers and vehicles, configure parameters, and run the algorithm to obtain an optimized routing solution.
